# Supabase Authentication & Sync Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Supabase authentication and sync system has been successfully implemented according to the approved plan. Here's what was built:

### 🔐 Authentication System
- **Magic Link Authentication**: Users can sign in with email magic links
- **Supabase Integration**: Full client/server setup with proper middleware
- **Auth Provider**: React context for managing authentication state
- **User Menu**: Dropdown with profile, sync status, and sign out options

### 🔒 Client-Side Encryption
- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption using WebCrypto API
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: 100,000 iterations for secure key generation
- **Key Management**: Secure in-memory key storage with session management
- **Salt Generation**: Random salt generation for each encryption operation

### 🔄 Data Sync System
- **Encrypted Sync**: All data encrypted before cloud transmission
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins strategy with version tracking
- **Background Sync**: Automatic sync every 3 minutes when online
- **Offline Support**: Graceful offline/online transitions
- **Migration Flow**: One-time migration from local to cloud storage

### 🎨 User Interface
- **Sign-In Button**: Integrated into landing page header
- **Migration Prompt**: Guided flow for first-time cloud sync
- **Sync Status Indicators**: Real-time sync status with floating notifications
- **Profile Page**: Complete user profile with sync settings and data management

### 🗄️ Database Schema
- **Profiles Table**: User profile information with encryption salt storage
- **Devices Table**: Device tracking for multi-device sync
- **Encrypted Blobs**: E2EE data storage with version control
- **Sync Log**: Audit trail for all sync operations
- **Row Level Security**: Complete data isolation between users

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
Create `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Database Migration
Run the SQL migration in `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` in your Supabase dashboard to create the required tables and RLS policies.

### 3. Testing
- Test magic link authentication flow
- Verify encryption/decryption works correctly
- Test sync functionality with multiple devices
- Validate offline/online transitions

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Security Features
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Data never leaves device unencrypted
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Server cannot decrypt user data
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **Secure Key Management**: Keys never stored on server

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Sync service loaded only when needed
- **Background Sync**: Non-blocking sync operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Efficient version-based conflict handling
- **Compression**: Data compressed before encryption

### User Experience
- **Offline-First**: App works without internet connection
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Sync is optional, not required
- **Clear Status**: Users always know sync state
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works even if sync fails
