# Research Foundations: Reflector

## Overview

Reflector is built on evidence from multiple domains of psychology and cognitive science, specifically designed to address epistemic autonomy—the ability to form and maintain beliefs based on evidence rather than social pressure or authority.

## Core Psychological Frameworks

### 1. Schema Therapy (Young, 2003)

**Core Concept**: Early maladaptive schemas are broad, pervasive themes regarding oneself and one's relationship with others, developed during childhood and elaborated throughout one's lifetime.

**Application to Reflector**:
- **Dependence Schema**: "I need others to survive or function properly"
- **Approval-Seeking Schema**: "I must be approved of by others to feel good about myself"
- **Punitive Parent Schema**: "I deserve punishment for my mistakes"
- **Unrelenting Standards Schema**: "I must meet very high standards to avoid criticism"

**Reflector Implementation**:
- Assessment items tagged with schema domains
- Non-judgmental prompts that surface schema patterns
- Self-awareness exercises that decouple emotional triggers from belief formation

### 2. Motivational Interviewing (Miller & Rollnick, 2013)

**Core Concept**: A collaborative, person-centered form of guiding to elicit and strengthen motivation for change.

**Key Principles**:
- **Express Empathy**: Non-judgmental acceptance
- **Develop Discrepancy**: Awareness of current vs. desired state
- **Roll with Resistance**: Avoid confrontation
- **Support Self-Efficacy**: Belief in ability to change

**Reflector Implementation**:
- Curious, non-coercive language throughout
- Self-generated insight prompts
- "What would it mean if this belief weren't true?" style questions
- User maintains complete autonomy over conclusions

### 3. Social Identity Theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979)

**Core Concept**: Individuals derive part of their self-concept from their membership in social groups.

**Key Mechanisms**:
- **Social Categorization**: Dividing world into "us" and "them"
- **Social Identification**: Adopting group norms and values
- **Social Comparison**: Evaluating groups relative to others
- **In-group Bias**: Favoring members of one's own group

**Reflector Implementation**:
- Identity Mirror module explores personal vs. group values
- Venn drift visualization shows tribal influence
- Source awareness training reduces in-group bias
- Mechanism-focused rather than position-focused critique

### 4. Metacognitive Therapy (Wells, 2009)

**Core Concept**: The ability to think about thinking, including awareness of cognitive processes and strategies to regulate them.

**Key Components**:
- **Metacognitive Knowledge**: Understanding of cognitive processes
- **Metacognitive Regulation**: Control over cognitive activities
- **Metacognitive Experiences**: Feelings and judgments about thinking

**Reflector Implementation**:
- "Notice your reaction to this question" prompts
- Reaction time tracking in Echo-Loop game
- Self-awareness scoring based on pattern recognition
- Metacognitive feedback loops throughout

## Assessment Constructs

### 1. Epistemic Autonomy Index (EAI)

**Definition**: Independence in belief formation from external identities and authorities.

**Theoretical Basis**: 
- Schema Therapy's dependence and approval-seeking schemas
- Social Identity Theory's group influence mechanisms
- Cognitive psychology research on authority bias

**Measurement Approach**:
- 12 items (6 forward, 6 reverse-coded)
- Mix of Likert scales and vignettes
- Targets: independence from group consensus, authority deference, social pressure

**Sample Items**:
- "Before sharing an opinion, I scan for whether it's truly mine." (forward)
- "When my favorite commentator changes their view, I usually update mine too." (reverse)

### 2. Reflective Flexibility (RF)

**Definition**: Willingness and ability to revise beliefs in light of counter-evidence.

**Theoretical Basis**:
- Cognitive flexibility research
- Confirmation bias studies
- Belief revision literature

**Measurement Approach**:
- 8 items (4 forward, 4 reverse-coded)
- Focus on disconfirmation seeking
- Targets: evidence evaluation, belief updating, cognitive rigidity

**Sample Items**:
- "I can list specific evidence that would change my mind about my strongest beliefs." (forward)
- "Once I've formed a strong opinion, new evidence rarely shifts it." (reverse)

### 3. Source Awareness (SA)

**Definition**: Conscious tracking of information provenance and source diversity.

**Theoretical Basis**:
- Source monitoring research
- Information literacy studies
- Echo chamber research

**Measurement Approach**:
- 8 items (4 forward, 4 reverse-coded)
- Focus on source tracking and diversification
- Targets: source memory, information seeking, echo chamber awareness

**Sample Items**:
- "I can name the first three places I heard the claims I repeat most often." (forward)
- "I rarely think about where my information comes from—I just know it." (reverse)

### 4. Affect Regulation in Debate (ARD)

**Definition**: Capacity to manage emotional reactivity when beliefs are challenged.

**Theoretical Basis**:
- Emotional regulation research
- Identity fusion studies
- Moral psychology findings

**Measurement Approach**:
- 8 items (4 forward, 4 reverse-coded)
- Focus on emotional reactivity and regulation
- Targets: emotional reasoning, identity fusion, debate composure

**Sample Items**:
- "When someone refutes 'my side,' I can stay curious for at least one minute." (forward)
- "Hearing someone praise a figure I dislike makes me feel angry or disgusted." (reverse)

## Psychometric Properties

### Reliability Targets
- **Cronbach's α ≥ 0.70** for each subscale
- **Test-retest reliability** for stability assessment
- **Internal consistency** across item types

### Validity Evidence
- **Content Validity**: Expert review of item relevance
- **Construct Validity**: Factor analysis and intercorrelations
- **Criterion Validity**: Relationship with related measures
- **Incremental Validity**: Unique variance beyond existing measures

### Response Integrity
- **Acquiescence Bias Detection**: Extreme agreement patterns
- **Straightlining Detection**: Repeated identical responses
- **Speed Detection**: Suspiciously fast completion
- **Attention Checks**: Embedded validity items

## Scoring Methodology

### Raw Score Calculation
1. **Reverse Coding**: 8 - value for reverse-coded items
2. **Mean Calculation**: Average across items per construct
3. **Scale Transformation**: (mean - 1) / 6 * 100 (0-100 scale)

### Confidence Intervals
- **Bootstrap Method**: 1000 resamples
- **95% Confidence Level**: Standard psychological practice
- **Precision Indicators**: CI width for reliability assessment

### Composite Scoring
- **Weighted Composite**: EAI (60%) + RF (40%)
- **Rationale**: EAI as primary indicator, RF as secondary
- **Alternative Weightings**: User-configurable in future versions

## Ethical Considerations

### Non-Coercive Design
- **User Autonomy**: Complete control over conclusions
- **Non-Judgmental Language**: Avoids pathologizing
- **Mechanism Focus**: Critiques processes, not positions
- **Self-Discovery**: User generates insights

### Privacy Protection
- **Local-First Storage**: No external data transmission
- **User Ownership**: Complete data control
- **Transparent Processing**: Clear data handling
- **Minimal Collection**: Only necessary data

### Clinical Boundaries
- **Educational Purpose**: Not therapeutic intervention
- **Self-Assessment**: Not clinical diagnosis
- **User Responsibility**: Professional help when needed
- **Clear Disclaimers**: Appropriate scope limitations

## Research Applications

### Potential Studies
1. **Longitudinal Tracking**: Autonomy development over time
2. **Intervention Studies**: Effectiveness of metacognitive training
3. **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Cultural differences in autonomy
4. **Predictive Validity**: Relationship to real-world outcomes

### Data Sharing
