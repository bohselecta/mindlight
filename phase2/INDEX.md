### Core Modules (Interactive Components)

#### 1. **Disconfirm Game** - `phase2-disconfirm-game.tsx`
**What it does:** Falsifiability training (cognitive inoculation)  
**Measures:** RF (Reflective Flexibility)  
**Key mechanic:** Users list conditions that would change their mind → scored on specificity vs vagueness  
**Innovation:** "You avoided naming falsifiers (certainty addiction detected)"  
**Integration:** → Progress Dashboard (RF score) → Badge: "Changed My Mind"  
**Build time:** 3-4 days  
**Lines:** ~600 (React component)

#### 2. **Schema Reclaim** - `phase2-schema-reclaim.tsx`
**What it does:** Emotional decoupling from belief formation  
**Measures:** ARD (Affect Regulation in Debate)  
**Key mechanic:** Identify schema trigger → 60-sec breathing → re-check belief certainty  
**Innovation:** Pre/post certainty delta shows regulation works  
**Integration:** → Progress Dashboard (ARD score) → Badge: "Calm Under Fire"  
**Build time:** 4-5 days  
**Lines:** ~650 (React component)

#### 3. **Influence Map** - `phase2-influence-map.tsx`
**What it does:** Information source visualization + homophily detection  
**Measures:** SA (Source Awareness)  
**Key mechanic:** Log sources → network graph → diversity metrics  
**Innovation:** Seeing your echo chamber is more powerful than hearing about it  
**Integration:** → Progress Dashboard (SA score) → Badge: "Source Sleuth"  
**Build time:** 5-6 days  
**Lines:** ~700 (React component with SVG visualization)

- Cards: `bg-slate-800/50` with `backdrop-blur`
- Borders: `border-slate-700`
- Text: Primary `text-slate-100`, Secondary `text-slate-400`

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Dynamic Tailwind Classes**
❌ `className={`bg-${color}-500`}`  
✅ `className={colorClasses[color]}`

### 2. **Mobile Neglect**
Test EVERY module on mobile first. 70%+ of users will be on phones.

### 3. **Over-Gamification**
Badges should celebrate progress, not create FOMO. Locked badges show "How to unlock," not "You're behind."

### 4. **Pushy Notifications**
"Quick reflection?" (gentle) not "You're about to lose your streak!" (guilt).

### 5. **Feature Creep**
Stick to the checklist. Don't add "just one more thing" before launch. Ship, iterate, improve.

### 6. **Ignoring Privacy**
Raw reflection text NEVER leaves device. Analytics tracks patterns, not content.

## 📞 Support & Questions

### If you get stuck:

**Technical issues:**
- Check implementation checklist for integration points
- Review master summary for architecture overview
- Verify storage schema matches across modules

**Design questions:**
- Follow color palette above
- Maintain "curious, respectful, gently irreverent" tone
- Test every feedback message for non-judgment

**Scope creep temptation:**
- Revisit PRD north star: "We don't tell you what to think"
- Phase 2 is depth + retention, not new features
- Ship, gather data, iterate

---

## 🎯 Your North Star

Every decision should answer: **Does this restore epistemic autonomy?**

If a feature:
- ✅ Helps users notice outsourced thinking → Ship it
- ✅ Trains metacognitive skills → Ship it
- ✅ Measures growth in autonomy → Ship it
- ❌ Tells users what to believe → Cut it
- ❌ Creates tribal identity → Cut it
- ❌ Gamifies for engagement over insight → Cut it

---

## 🏆 What Success Looks Like

**User testimonials you want:**
- "I realized I was outsourcing my opinions to one podcast"
- "I can now disagree with my dad without getting defensive"
- "I caught myself in confirmation bias mid-scroll"
- "This helped me leave [high-control group] without losing my mind"

**Not:**
- "This changed my political views"
- "I now believe X instead of Y"

**The goal:** Autonomy, not conversion.
