# Motivated Reasoning

**Conclusion first, justification second.** Motivated reasoning is when you 
unconsciously work backwards from a desired conclusion, gathering "evidence" 
that supports what you already want to believe.

### How It Works

1. Encounter new information
2. Emotional reaction (do I *want* this to be true?)
3. Cognitive search (find reasons to support preferred conclusion)
4. Rationalization ("I'm being objective")

You genuinely believe you're reasoning logicallyâ€”but the emotional preference 
set the destination before the journey began.

### The Emotional Tells

Watch for these patterns:
- **Relief** when "your side" is vindicated
- **Anxiety** when contradictory evidence appears
- **Creativity spike** when defending a preferred belief (you suddenly find 10 reasons)
- **Rigid certainty** despite thin evidence

If you feel *invested* in a conclusion being true, motivated reasoning is likely active.

### Decoupling Practice

1. Notice the emotional charge *before* evaluating evidence
2. Ask: "Would I accept this reasoning if it led to the opposite conclusion?"
3. Steelman the position you *don't* want to be true
