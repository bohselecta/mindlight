# Confirmation Bias

## What It Is

Confirmation bias is your mind's tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in ways that confirm what you already believe.

**You don't evaluate evidence neutrally. You evaluate it through the lens of what you already think is true.**

## The Core Mechanism

When you encounter new information:
- ✅ **Confirms your belief**: You accept it quickly, remember it clearly, share it freely
- ❌ **Contradicts your belief**: You scrutinize it harshly, forget it easily, dismiss it as flawed

This isn't conscious deception. It's automatic pattern-matching that feels like clear thinking.

## How It Manifests

### In Information Seeking
You Google to *confirm*, not to *check*:
- "Evidence that [thing I believe]" vs. "Is [thing I believe] true?"
- You click headlines that validate your position
- You skip articles that might challenge it

### In Interpretation
Same facts, different conclusions:
- A study supporting your view: "Well-designed, large sample, clear methodology"
- A study contradicting it: "Flawed design, biased authors, conflicts of interest"

The standards shift based on the conclusion.

### In Memory
You remember:
- That time someone from the other side said something extreme
- The one study that proved your point
- Anecdotes that fit your narrative

You forget:
- Nuance in positions you disagree with
- Counter-evidence you encountered
- Times you were wrong

## The Feeling

Confirmation bias *feels like being right*. The more you seek confirming evidence, the more obvious your position seems. Your certainty grows—but your accuracy doesn't.

## Why It Happens

Your brain is optimizing for efficiency and coherence, not truth:
1. **Cognitive ease**: Confirming info is easier to process
2. **Identity protection**: Beliefs are often tied to self-concept
3. **Social alignment**: Shared beliefs = group belonging

## Real-World Test

Pick a strong belief you hold. Now try this:

**Instead of**: "Find evidence that I'm right"  
**Try**: "List specific evidence that would prove me wrong"

If you can't list any falsifiers, or if they all sound absurd, you're likely confirming rather than evaluating.

## The Path Out

1. **Flip your search**: Actively look for the best case *against* your position
2. **Assume competence**: What if smart people who disagree aren't stupid or evil?
3. **Check your standards**: Are you applying the same rigor to confirming and disconfirming evidence?
4. **Track updates**: When did you last change your mind?

## The Insight

Confirmation bias doesn't make you wrong. But it can lock you into being right *by accident*—and you'd never know.

**The cure isn't neutrality. It's honesty about what you're actually doing when you "research."**

*Everyone does this. The question is: Do you notice when you're doing it?*
