# Confirmation Bias

**You notice evidence that confirms your beliefs more than evidence that challenges them.** 
This isn't a character flawâ€”it's a cognitive default.

### Why It Happens

Your brain is a pattern-recognition machine optimized for efficiency, not accuracy. 
Challenging a belief requires mental energy. Confirming it feels like progress.

Result: You unconsciously weight supportive evidence higher and dismiss contradictory 
data as "outliers" or "biased sources."

### The Stealth Factor

Confirmation bias is invisible *to the person experiencing it*. Everyone thinks 
they're being rational. The real test: **can you list what would change your mind?**

If your answer is vague ("nothing" or "I'd need overwhelming proof"), you're in 
confirmation lock.

### Self-Correction

1. **Falsification practice**: Before defending a belief, list 3 conditions that would disprove it
2. **Seek disconfirmation**: Actively search for the *best* opposing argument (not the weakest strawman)
3. **Track your certainty**: High certainty + low exposure to counterevidence = red flag
