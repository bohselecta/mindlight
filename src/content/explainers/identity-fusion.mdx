# Identity Fusion

</div>

Identity fusion happens when your **personal identity** merges with a **group identity** 
so thoroughly that challenging the group feels like a personal attack.

### The Process

1. **Boundary dissolution**: "I believe X" becomes "I *am* an X-ist"
2. **Loyalty intensifies**: Defending the group feels like self-defense
3. **Criticism = threat**: Disagreement registers as danger, not debate

### Why It Matters

Fused identities create **belief rigidity**. You can't revise a position without 
feeling like you're betraying yourself or your tribe.

Example: "I'm a progressive" (identity) vs "I support progressive policies" (position). 
The latter can change with evidence. The former cannot without identity crisis.

### The Schema Connection

Identity fusion often stems from:
- **Approval-seeking**: Need for belonging drives fusion
- **Defectiveness**: "If I'm wrong, I'm worthless"
- **Dependence**: Outsourcing judgment to the group

### Reclaiming Boundaries

Ask yourself:
- Do I hold this belief because of *evidence* or *belonging*?
- Would I still believe this if I left my current community?
- Can I separate my values from my tribal labels?
