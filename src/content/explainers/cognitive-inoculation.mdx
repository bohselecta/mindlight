# Cognitive Inoculation

Just like vaccines expose you to weakened pathogens to build immunity, **cognitive 
inoculation** exposes you to weak misinformation to strengthen your defenses.

### How It Works

1. Pre-exposure to manipulation tactics
2. Recognition training (spot the pattern)
3. Refutation practice (counter weak arguments)
4. Resilience building (harder to fool later)

Example: If you've practiced identifying emotional manipulation in headlines, 
you're less likely to fall for it in the wild.

### Why It's Powerful

Traditional fact-checking is reactive (debunking after belief formation). 
Inoculation is *preventive*â€”you develop pattern recognition before 
encountering persuasive content.

### What You're Inoculating Against

- Emotional manipulation ("be afraid/angry")
- False dichotomies ("you're either with us or against us")
- Strawman arguments (attacking weak versions of opposing views)
- Source laundering (obscuring where info came from)

### Practice

The Disconfirm Game and Echo-Loop train inoculation by:
- Exposing you to manipulative framing
- Making you conscious of your emotional reactions
- Rewarding pattern recognition
