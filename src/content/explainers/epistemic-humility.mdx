# Epistemic Humility

**Knowing what you don't know.** Epistemic humility is the capacity to hold 
beliefs provisionally, recognize your cognitive limits, and update when evidence shifts.

### What It's NOT

- ❌ Wishy-washy relativism ("all opinions are equal")
- ❌ Performative uncertainty ("I have no views")
- ❌ Self-deprecation ("I'm probably wrong about everything")

### What It IS

- ✅ Calibrated confidence (strong beliefs on strong evidence, weak beliefs on weak evidence)
- ✅ Falsifiability (knowing what would change your mind)
- ✅ Intellectual courage (admitting error without identity collapse)

### The Paradox

High epistemic humility often correlates with *deeper expertise*. Experts know 
the complexity and uncertainty. Novices think it's simple.

Dunning-Kruger in action: Low knowledge → high certainty. High knowledge → moderate certainty.

### Practice

Ask yourself:
- On a scale of 1-10, how certain am I?
- What's my confidence interval? (60% sure? 90%?)
- If I'm wrong, what would that look like?
