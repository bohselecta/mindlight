# Certainty Addiction

Some people crave certainty the way others crave sugar. Ambiguity feels *wrong*. 
Nuance feels weak. "I don't know" feels like failure.

### The Psychology

High need for cognitive closure = discomfort with uncertainty. Your brain wants 
**answers now**, even if incomplete evidence suggests waiting would be wiser.

This isn't about intelligence—it's about tolerance for ambiguity.

### The Trap

Certainty addiction makes you:
- Accept weak evidence if it provides closure
- Reject strong evidence if it creates doubt
- Confuse confidence with correctness

Result: You feel certain, but you're often *precisely wrong* instead of *approximately right*.

### The Antidote

Practice saying:
- "I don't know yet"
- "The evidence is mixed"
- "I'm 60% confident, not 100%"

Uncertainty isn't weakness—it's **epistemic honesty**.
