# Source Amnesia

## What It Is

Source amnesia is when you remember *what* you know but forget *where* you learned it. The information feels true because you believe it—but you can't trace it back to a reliable origin.

**You remember the claim. You forget the source. You treat it as fact.**

## How It Works

Your brain stores content and context separately:
- **Content**: "Claim X is true"
- **Context**: "I heard X from [person/source] in [situation]"

Over time, context fades faster than content. You're left with:
- ✅ The belief
- ❌ Why you believed it

## The Problem

When you can't remember the source, your brain fills in the gap:
- "I must have read it somewhere credible"
- "Everyone knows this"
- "I've always thought this"

The belief feels self-evident—because you've forgotten it wasn't always yours.

## Real-World Examples

### Political Claims
"I know [politician] said [outrageous thing]"  
*Did they? Or did you see it in a meme, a satirical account, or someone's paraphrase?*

### Health Information
"I heard that [supplement/diet] is proven to work"  
*From a peer-reviewed study? A documentary? A podcast ad? Your friend's cousin?*

### Historical "Facts"
"Everyone knows [historical event] happened because of [cause]"  
*Did you verify this, or did you absorb it from a textbook, movie, or Wikipedia?*

## Why It Happens

### 1. Repetition Without Sourcing
The more you encounter a claim, the more familiar it feels. Familiarity becomes "truth."

### 2. Social Proof
If multiple people repeat the same claim, your brain stores it as consensus rather than rumor.

### 3. Cognitive Ease
Remembering sources is cognitively expensive. Your brain defaults to "I know this" and skips the verification step.

## The Danger Cascade

```
You forget the source →
The claim feels self-evident →
You repeat it confidently →
Others absorb it without checking →
It spreads as "common knowledge" →
No one can trace it to origin
```

**Misinformation thrives on source amnesia.**

## Signs You Have It

- You can confidently state a fact but can't name where you learned it
- When asked for a source, you say "I read it somewhere" or "It's well known"
- You've repeated claims that later turned out to be false or exaggerated
- You can't distinguish what you personally verified vs. what you absorbed

## How to Combat It

### 1. Source Tagging
When you encounter new information, actively note:
- Where did this come from?
- Who benefits if this is believed?
- Is this primary evidence or someone's interpretation?

### 2. The Trace-Back Test
Before repeating a claim, ask:
- Can I name the original source?
- Have I personally checked it?
- Or am I just passing along what I absorbed?

### 3. Track Your Beliefs
Keep a simple log:
- **Belief**: [Statement]
- **Source**: [Where I first heard this]
- **Verified**: [Yes/No]

### 4. Assume Gaps
Default to "I don't remember where I learned this" rather than "This is obviously true"

## The Meta-Problem

Source amnesia makes you certain about things you shouldn't be certain about. You've forgotten the shaky foundation but kept the confident conclusion.

## The Practice

Pick 3 strong beliefs you hold right now. Ask:
1. Where did I first encounter this idea?
2. Have I checked the original source, or did I absorb it secondhand?
3. What evidence would I need to see to question it?

If you can't answer #1, you have source amnesia for that belief.

## The Insight

**Not remembering where you learned something doesn't make it false.**  
**But it should make you less certain.**
