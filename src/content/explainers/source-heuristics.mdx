# Source Heuristics

You trust information based on *who said it* more than *what the evidence shows*. 
This is efficient but exploitable.

### The Mechanism

Your brain uses shortcuts:
- **Authority**: "An expert said it" → probably true
- **Similarity**: "Someone like me said it" → relatable, trustworthy
- **Familiarity**: "I've heard this before" → must be accurate
- **Emotional resonance**: "This aligns with my values" → feels right

These heuristics work *most of the time*, but they're not truth detectors.

### The Hijack

- Charismatic figures exploit authority heuristics
- Echo chambers exploit similarity bias
- Repetition exploits familiarity (the "illusory truth effect")
- Tribal content exploits emotional resonance

Result: You feel like you're evaluating evidence, but you're actually outsourcing 
judgment to source credibility.

### Self-Check

Before accepting a claim, ask:
1. Who benefits if I believe this?
2. Am I trusting the person or the evidence?
3. Would I believe this from a source I dislike?
